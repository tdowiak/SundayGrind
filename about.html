    <h2> Who is Writing This?</h2>
    <p> My name is Tyler Dowiak.  I am 25 years old and have been playing paintball since I was 12.
    In 2006, I played a local 2v2 tournament with a highschool buddy and have been hooked ever since.
    From 2007-2014 I played for a laundry list of teams competing in local and regional events along
    with a couple years of college paintball at Penn State. At the start of the 2015 season I was
    still ranked D4 and was extremely frustrated that I had been playing so long and there were seemingly
    no teams around that I could join and compete at a higher level.  It turns out i was wrong.</p>

    <p>The DZ Allstars, a local Division 4 5-man team, had just won the 2014 PSP D4 5-man series which included
    a prize of half-off entry to all X-Ball events in 2015.  I joined the team along with 4-5 other new
    guys and we headed into the 2015 season as a mostly new Division 3 X-Ball team.  We practiced nearly every
    Sunday all off-season, often driving 4-6 hours to get a few points in against Pro and D1 teams.
    We made Sunday at our first event and won our second event.  The win cemented our future as a team,
    and we decided we were going to take this team as far as we could.  We finished the 2015 season 1st
    overall in Division 3, then bumped up to Division 2 in 2016.  We won another event in Division 2 and
    finished 2nd overall for the season.  It is now 2017 and we have begun our first season as a semi-pro team. </p>

    <p>Our journey is far from over, but I have already learned so much that would have helped me
    earlier in my career and I feel compelled to share it so that it might help others.  This blog
    will not delve too deep into how to play paintball.  There are countless pros who are far better
    players and teachers than myself so I will leave most of the paintball teaching to them.  My goal
    with this blog is not to make you better at paintball, but rather to make you better at getting
    better. I want to show young players and teams what they have to do to climb up the ranks.  And
    I want to hopefully dispel some myths about what makes a good player and what makes a good team.
