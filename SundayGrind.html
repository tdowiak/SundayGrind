    <h1> Why you are still D4. </h1>
    <p class = "visible"> "D4 for life."  "Forever D4." "I've been playing for 7 years and I'm still ranked D4."  I can't even
    count the number of times I've heard this. Often times they are totally perplexed at how they
    haven't progressed past the "rookie" rank in our sport. Even worse, most of them believe they
    "should be ranked higher" (maybe some of you should, but most of you shouldn't.)  My goal is
    to hopefully clear up some confusion about why you are struggling to move up the ranks.</p>
    <p class="hidden">  Let me preface this by saying I do not believe APPA rankings are a
    good measure of skill, but they do give an idea of how successful a player has been in recent years. So
    in essence, a D4 ranking equates to "not very succesful." There are a lot of possible reasons for this,
    but they all boil down to two basic problems: you aren't putting in enough effort as an individual and
    you aren't putting in enough effort as a team. </p>
