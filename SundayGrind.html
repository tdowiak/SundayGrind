    <h1 class = "article-title"> Why you are still D4. </h1>
    <p class="visible"> "D4 for life."  "Forever D4." "I've been playing for 7 years and I'm still ranked D4."  I can't even
    count the number of times I've heard this. Often times they are totally perplexed at how they
    haven't progressed past the "rookie" rank in our sport. Even worse, most of them believe they
    "should be ranked higher" (maybe some of you should, but most of you shouldn't.)  My goal is
    to hopefully clear up some confusion about why might be struggling to move up the ranks.</p>
    <p class="hidden">  Let me preface this by saying I do not believe APPA rankings are a
    good indicator of skill, but they do give an idea of how successful a player has been in recent years. So
    in essence, a D4 ranking generally means you've been... not very succesful. There are a lot of possible reasons for this,
    but they all boil down to two basic problems: you aren't putting in enough effort as an individual and
    you aren't putting in enough effort as a team. </p>
    <p class = "hidden">"But I'm practicing every Sunday!!" Good! That's a great start. Unfortunately there's much
    more to getting better than simply showing up and playing paintball. You have to be mentally engaged in every every
    game and drill i.e. actually focusing on improving a certain aspect of your game. This might mean focusing all your
    mental energy into getting to the 50 snake as quickly as possible or simply holding your gun with proper form.
    Each practice choose two aspects of your game that you feel are weak and work on improving just those two things.
    You may want to watch better players (preferably pros) to see how they do the thing you're struggling with. </p>
    <p class = "hidden">"What if I don't know what I need to work on?" If you're asking this question, you're probably
    either winning every game in practice against terrible competition or losing every game against competition that is
    way out of your league. If the former, you need to find a way to practice against competition that actually challenges
    you and your team. If the latter, pay closer attention to how the other team is beating you. A good trick is to watch
    how they are killing your first two bodies. Once a team gets a 2-body advantage, they are going to win that point 90%
    of the time. Usually there will be a trend.</p>
