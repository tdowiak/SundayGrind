      <h1 class = "article-title"> The Most Important Skills in the Modern Game </h1>
      <p class="visible"> Tournament style paintball provides one of the most unique combinations
      of physical skills, strategy, and team work in any sport.  Some compare it to playing chess
      with guns.  To succeed you must first strategically plan an effective breakout that will hopefully
      give your team an early advantage.  Then, you must use your physical skills to execute the breakout.
      After the breakout, you must figure out where the other team's players are and either shoot them or
      figure out a plan to move yourself or a teammate to a better position.  All of this must be accomplished
      while avoiding getting shot and preventing the other team from moving into better positions.  This already
      long list of tasks is further complicated by the fact that your ability to look around the field is limited
      by the threat of being shot if you stick your head out. On top of that, your hearing is limited by the sound
      of paintballs hitting your bunker and by your own gun firing.  If this all seems difficult to you, you're
      not crazy.  So if you're having trouble winning, where do you start?

      <h1 class = "article-title"> Why you are still D4. </h1>
      <p class="visible"> "D4 for life."  "Forever D4." "I've been playing for 7 years and I'm still ranked D4."  I can't even
      count the number of times I've heard this. Often times they are totally perplexed at how they
      haven't progressed past the "rookie" rank in our sport. Even worse, most of them believe they
      "should be ranked higher" (maybe some of you should, but most of you shouldn't.)  My goal is
      to hopefully clear up some confusion about why might be struggling to move up the ranks.</p>
      <p class="hidden">  Let me preface this by saying I do not believe APPA rankings are a
      good indicator of skill, but they do give an idea of how successful a player has been in recent years. So
      in essence, a D4 ranking generally means you've been... not very succesful. There are a lot of possible reasons for this,
      but they all boil down to two basic problems: you aren't putting in enough effort as an individual and
      you aren't putting in enough effort as a team. </p>
      <p class = "hidden">"But I'm practicing every Sunday!!" Good! That's a great start. Unfortunately there's much
      more to getting better than simply showing up and playing paintball. You have to be mentally engaged in every every
      game and drill i.e. actually focusing on improving a certain aspect of your game. This might mean focusing all your
      mental energy into getting to the 50 snake as quickly as possible or simply holding your gun with proper form.
      Each practice choose two aspects of your game that you feel are weak and work on improving just those two things.
      You may want to watch better players (preferably pros) to see how they do the thing you're struggling with. </p>
      <p class = "hidden">"What if I don't know what I need to work on?" If you're asking this question, you're probably
      either winning every game in practice against terrible competition or losing every game against competition that is
      way out of your league. If the former, you need to find a way to practice against competition that actually challenges
      you and your team. If the latter, pay closer attention to how the other team is beating you. A good trick is to watch
      how they are killing your first two bodies. Once a team gets a 2-body advantage, they are going to win that point 90%
      of the time. Usually there will be a trend.</p>
